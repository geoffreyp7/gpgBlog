## [Newy Ship Guide](http://www.newyshipguide.com)

The Port of Newcastle is a shipping hot spot, with many ships coming and going everyday. A lot of people love to know about the ships and when they can spot one. Unfortunately the only way to find out was a fairly unfriendly webpage. So I developed a much nicer site using React (have a look for yourself). The site has a basic back end (running on AWS EC2) which is running a bash script to regularly source the latest information from the old site. The info is then displayed nicely on the front end. The site is served from an S3 bucket for cheap, yet highly available hosting. The site is responsive.

## The Worm

Currently in development. Inspired by "the worm" that sometimes makes appearances (particularly during political debates) on TV, this project aims to bring it to anyone, anywhere. Have you ever wondered what others are thinking of a presentation? (maybe even your own), what about whether certain demographics like what is being said? This project aims to reveal all that and more. The web app is being built with an Angular front end and .Net Core on the back end. MySQL (via Entity Framework Core) is in use as the database. The SignalR websocket library is used to provide real-time feedback. The first (beta) release of the app is tentatively planned around April.
